Please remind you need to run the server code into your machine to see data. Servercode was provided by the creatella and I also include in the /serverCode

## About Features

I've implemented all the features instead one. That is

- to improve the user's experience, we should always pre-emptively fetch the next batch of results in advance, making use of idle-time. But they still should not be displayed until the user has scrolled to the bottom of the product grid.

## About Project

- I've used bootstrap for writing the css, because you said it's pretty flexible!
- I used axios for the data fetching!
- I used hook instead of normal states and lifecycle!
- I didn't add react-router or redux because you tell me to make it simple and easy!
- I used uuid for creating the random string for the ads. uuid ensure I'm getting a unique id everytime. So user will never see the same ads again!
- I like to structure project by components, pages, services, redux & utils normally and I used it. There is atomic design and other stuffs I don't have any issues with it, but I feel like this one is really simple!
- I didn't added any test. Because of limited time!

## Total Time

I spend total 6 hours in this project for 1 hour in 1 day!
